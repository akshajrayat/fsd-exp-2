This project focuses on designing and implementing a fully responsive user interface using React and Material UI. The application includes a Landing Page, Dashboard, and Admin Panel, all optimized for different screen sizes such as mobile, tablet, and desktop.

The Landing Page is built using Material UI Grid and Typography components. On small screens, the sections stack vertically, while on larger screens they appear side by side using Material UI breakpoints. This ensures proper responsiveness and readability.

The Dashboard layout consists of a top navigation bar and a responsive card grid. The number of card columns automatically adjusts based on screen width, showing one column on mobile, two on tablets, and multiple columns on larger screens. Reusable Material UI Card components are used to display content.

The Admin Panel is fully responsive and includes light and dark theme switching using Material UI’s ThemeProvider. Custom styled overrides are applied to components such as Button, Card, and AppBar to maintain a consistent look and feel. The multi-panel layout collapses into a single-column layout on mobile devices.

Navigation between pages is handled using React Router, enabling smooth transitions without page reloads. The application runs locally using the Vite development server on
http://localhost:5173.

Key technologies used in this project include React.js, Material UI, React Router DOM, Vite, CSS, and npm. The project demonstrates modern UI design principles, responsiveness, theme customization, and efficient component-based development.
